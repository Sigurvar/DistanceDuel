## Run the application:
### Start the java server:
In order to start the java server, load the project into eclipse and add the jar file ```java-json.jar``` to the classpath in the build path configuration. 
### Configure the mobile application:
Load the application into android studio. Then get the local IP of the machine running the java application and update the host of the ```new Socket()``` constructor to the local IP of the server. (Note that both the devices have to be on the same network for the application to run) 
### Start the mobile application:
The application can be transfered to any device that supports android sdk version 23 or higher, or it can be run with the android emulator within Android Studio


When both the application and the server is running you can play the game!!!
